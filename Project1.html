<h2>Pitchfork</h2>

	<li>My first impression of this site was that I thought it was a little boring and bland. It isn't very eye pleasing.</li>
	<li>I didn't care for the flow and wasn't impressed with the organization of it. They didn't have links specifically on the left or right, they were throughout the site.</li>
	<li>It wasn't structured great but it still wasn't confusing to navigate.</li>
	<li>Graphics are dull in my opinion and not very eye catching. I felt it wasn't a great layout and kind of bland because of the mostly black and white imaging.</li>
	<li>The home page loaded fairly quickly and reasonably.</li>
	<li>The text color and size were reasonable. It used different sizes and fonts.</li>
	<li>The navigation bar is at the top of the page and easily visible. It was well done because it is in a logically location on the page.</li>
	<li>The first page was mostly black and white in color and design while the next pages had more colorful images and setup.</li>
	<li>Smaller window size didn't change its attributes and it retained its set up.</li>
	<li>Article layout is easy to follow and navigate. I felt it was a little unusual to be so bland in design.</li>
</ol>
